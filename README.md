### All Hard Drops
*All Hard Drops* is a data visualization of my Slack conversations with my SVA IXD classmates. Each drop point on the canvas represents one classmate (there are 17 in total.) The points ripple when there's a message, with the color indicating the degree of positive/negative sentiment of the message.
